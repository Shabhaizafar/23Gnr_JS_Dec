    1)Write a JavaScript program to sort the items of an array.
Sample array : var arr1 = [ -3, 8, 7, 6, 5, -4, 3, 2, 1 ];
Sample Output : -4,-3,1,2,3,5,6,7,8

    2)Write a JavaScript program to find the most frequent item in an array.
Sample array : var arr1=[3, 'a', 'a', 'a', 2, 3, 'a', 3, 'a', 2, 4, 9, 3];
Sample Output : a ( 5 times )

3) Write a JavaScript program that accepts a string as input and swaps the case of each character. For example if you input 'The Quick Brown Fox' the output should be 'tHE qUICK bROWN fOX'.

4)Write a JavaScript program that prints the elements of the following array.
Note : Use nested for loops.

Sample Output :
"row 0"
" 1"
" 2"
" 1"
" 24"

Sample array : [NaN, 0, 15, false, -22, '',undefined, 47, null]
Expected result : [15, -22, 47]

8)  Write a JavaScript program to find a pair of elements (indices of the two numbers) in a given array whose sum equals a specific target number.

Input: numbers= [10,20,30,40,50,60,70], target=50
